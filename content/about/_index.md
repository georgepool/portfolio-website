I'm George, a 3rd year Compsci @ Cambridge.

Professionally, I'm mainly interested in:
- How we can use technology to mitigate climate change
- Building startups (99.9% still learning)
- Improving racial diversity in tech

I have completed SWEng internships at [Sourceful (summer 2023)](https://sourceful.com) and [Isometric (summer 2024)](https://isometric.com).

Academically, I'm interested in a wide range of areas. I like to see how ideas in theoretical computer science can be used to solve real-world problems.

I'm currently working on the following at Cambridge:
- My Part II Project
- Building Cambridge Colour in Tech - President (2024)
- Helping build Cambridge Black Ventures - Tech Officer (2024)
- Continuing with Emma Film Soc - Co-President (2023)
- Continuing with ECSU - [Racial Equalities Officer (2024)](https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/27420)

Outside of my technical side, I am interested in: 
- Politics (currently an inactive Labour Party member)
- Filmmaking (although [I've never gotten close to finishing a film](https://x.com/barbieheimer/status/1830760816221561215))
- Diversity in Higher Education and Tech
- Racquet sports (current ranking: padel (I know), squash (semi-retired because of knee injury), tennis, table tennis, the rest)
- Public / non-public speaking and how best to communicate ideas (99.9% still learning)

I also like to write and you'll be able to find some blogs on here.
