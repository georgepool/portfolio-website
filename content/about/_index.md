I'm George, a 3rd year Compsci @ Cambridge.

Professionally, I'm mainly interested in:
- How technology can help mitigate climate change
- Startups
- Improving racial diversity in tech

I have completed SWEng internships at [Sourceful (summer 2023)](https://sourceful.com) and [Isometric (summer 2024)](https://isometric.com).

Academically, I'm interested in a wide range of areas. I like to see how ideas in theoretical computer science can be used to solve real-world problems.

I'm currently working on the following at Cambridge:
- [My Part II Project]({{<relref "part-ii-project/_index.md">}})
- Building Cambridge Diversity in Tech - President (2024)
- Helping build Cambridge Black Ventures - Tech Officer (2024)
- Continuing with [Emma Film Soc - Co-President (2023)](https://instagram.com/emmafilmsoc/)
- Continuing with ECSU - [Racial Equalities Officer (2024)](https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/27420)

Outside of my technical side, I am interested in: 
- Politics
- Filmmaking (although [I've never gotten close to finishing a film](https://x.com/barbieheimer/status/1830760816221561215))
- Diversity in Higher Education and Tech
- Racquet sports (currently getting into padel)
- Speaking (still pretty crap at it)
