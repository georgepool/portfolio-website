Hi, I'm George, a 3rd year Compsci @ Cambridge.

Professionally, I'm mainly interested in climate tech, startups, (and of course am interested in all things tech).

I have completed SWEng internships at [Sourceful (summer 2023)](https://sourceful.com) and [Isometric (summer 2024)](https://isometric.com).

I also like to write and you'll be able to find some blogs on here.

Find out more about me (including my face) on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/george-pool)
